# Exercise: power recur

Write a function recurPower(base, exp) which computes baseexp by recursively calling itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem, and then multiplying the result by base to solve the initial problem.

This function should take in two values - base can be a float or an integer; exp will be an integer â‰¥0. It should return one numerical value. Your code must be recursive - use of the ** operator or looping constructs is not allowed.
